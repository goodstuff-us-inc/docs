# Getting Started

### Upon completing this guide, you should have a fully-functioning dev environment.

1. Join the GoodStuff [GitHub organization](https://github.com/goodstuff-us-inc)
1. Clone the "GoodStuff" repository to your local filesystem
    - e.g. `git clone git@github.com:goodstuff-us-inc/GoodStuff.git`
1. Note that GoodStuff is an `expo` project; you will need to [install the expo CLI toolkit to proceed](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/)
    - (`expo` is an NPM package; you will need `node` and `npm` to install it via the `npm` package manager)
1. Install the [`aws`](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [`amplify`](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli) CLI tools locally
1. Contact the GoodStuff team to get an AIM username and password for the GoodStuff AWS account
1. Pull the Amplify environments to your local machine. There are two environments: `prod` and `test`
1. You should now have all the framework dependencies needed to begin development
